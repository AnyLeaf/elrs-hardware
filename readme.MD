# AnyLeaf ELRS 2.4Ghz diversity Rx hardware

This repo contains published hardware information for the AnyLeaf ELRS receivers.
It contains schematics, KiCad schematic and PCB layout files, and production files
(Gerbers, drill files, bill of materials (BOM), and pick+place files). If you have any questions
or concerns, please post a Github issue here, or contact us at [anyleaf@anyleaf.org](mailto:anyleaf@anyleaf.org).

## This repo contains 2 designs:
- Single radio (SX1280), with ESP8285 MCU, and SkyWorks LNA/PA/antenna mux
- Dual radio (SX1280), with ESP32-PICO-V3 MCU, and AT2401C LNA/PAs.

Images of the schematics are provided as PNG files in the main repo; this is the easiest
way to view the schematics.

To view details, including PCB layouts, open the schematic and/or PCB files in 
[KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/).

For info on specific parts chosen, including part numbers at Digikey and LCSC, open
the schematic files in KiCad, and examine part properties.
